The implications of adding road convoys to a game emphasizing player control over sprawling maps are obvious.

Supply convoys are essentially giant mystery boxes on 22.5" wheels, peaking the greed, curiousity, and excitement of nearby individuals. I'm not an expert on psychology, but I'm pretty sure a big moving dollar sign traveling across the map has a certain allure to players.

Furthermore:

* you get to blow something up
* there could be ANYTHING inside, including ...
* enemy soldiers instead of precious cargo

### economic implications
Beyond the above, the implementation of convoys to the sprawling maps present in Arma 3 will assuredly add a plethora of interesting economic aspect to the game, while also providing an *extremely* dynamic platform for randomly generated ai tasks.

Ideally, convoys will be both predictable and dynamic at once:

* a convoy could be marked or unmarked
* having limited or no control over the route taken by the convoy adds a grittiness to the encounters when crossing heavily occupied enemy territory
* due to the random elements of zone populations, the presence of enemy patrols will be unknown without significant planning
* challenging convoy escort encounters highlight the value of coordinating with coop teammates performing overwatch of an area

Most of all, interactions with convoy supply lines provide players with a dependable source of income that can be built upon. I feel that this stability allows the other more random aspects of the game to become both more interesting and enjoyable.

## player-owned convoys
> The presence of player purchased convoys autonomously navigating the map also ensures that time and resources invested into expanding map control ties directly into a group's bottom line.

Concepts from other modules begin to gain in value as well:

* building guard towers and supplying them with troops, weapons, and supplies
* controlling road sections and clearing surrounding territory to faciliate safe passage of vehicles
* fortification of villages and towns becomes more attractive when they're the focal point of a valuable delivery 

### excellent center of conflict for pvp

### interesting mobile defense dynamics
Spaghetti westerns, anyone? Passengers can fire from vehicles as of the Helicopters DLC. Get your cowboy on.

### road sabotage
(Believable) fixed route vehicle pathing (roads) allows for explosives and traps to provide more value to a player. This has a cool factor and ensures a certain amount of scarcity can be assigned to explosives without affecting the usefulness.

### convoy hijacking
Can be the result of either an ai generated task or just a player seizing a moment of opportunity for personal gains.
* mechanics such as the ability to purchase and install vehicle upgrades gain in value

### fast-travel
Convoys allow for the implementation of a player fast-travel system, built on a believable set of circumstances.

Even without the presence of fast-travel, moving across the map on a convoy presents an opportunity for more time to be spent on management tasks through tools such as the inventory system, radio, map, or an alternative set of player-specific economy menus.

### interaction
Players approaching within a given distance of a convoy might be presented with an on screen alert, notifying them that a convoy-specific radio menu has been added.
