### Population Zones
- translates parameters received into a fully populated zone
- each zone is randomly generated from an array of entities:
- vehicles; random condition and container contents
- civilians; random models

### Populating a Zone
- the number of entities in each zone is determined by a single parameter, **populationSize**
- affects the no. of groups in the area (no. of units in each group is independently random)
- each value for populationSize increases the no. of **encounters** generated by ~25-30%

### Influencing Populations
- populationWeight is specified as an ordered array of strings
- any population listed receives priority when the zone is randomly populated
- populationExcept is also specified as an ordered array of strings
- any population listed in the array is **not** added to the zone's population pool

### Examples
`populate = [["mkr_1"], ["hide", "150", "noDebug"], ["medium", ["csat","supplies"], "civilians"]]`

- generate a medium number of populations on "mkr_1" if a player is within 150m of it;
- when generating, place MORE populations from the "enemies" and "supplies" pools;
- when generating, do NOT place populations from the "civilians" pool;
