## Population Zones
- translates parameters received into a fully populated zone
- each zone is randomly generated from an array of entities:
- vehicles; random condition and container contents
- civilians; random models

## Populating a Zone
- the number of entities in each zone is determined by a single parameter, **populationSize**
- affects the no. of groups in the area (no. of units in each group is independently random)
- each value for populationSize increases the no. of **encounters** generated by ~25-30%

## Influencing Populations
- populationWeight is specified as an ordered array of strings
- any population listed receives priority when the zone is randomly populated
- populationExcept is also specified as an ordered array of strings
- any population listed in the array is **not** added to the zone's population pool

## Examples
`populate = [["mkr_1"], ["hide", "150", "noDebug"], ["medium", ["csat","supplies"], "civilians"]]`

- generate a medium number of populations on "mkr_1" if a player is within 150m of it;
- when generating, place MORE populations from the "enemies" and "supplies" pools;
- when generating, do NOT place populations from the "civilians" pool;

## map load - generate new zones

## get zone parameters

## define additional zone meta-parameters using specified parameters
- zone status
- zone visibility
- zone color

## setup zone triggers

### player enters (or reenters) the zone - case statement that checks zone status
- indicate entry into zone and zone status via popup

#### zone status == inactive
- if no population exists => generate a population pool for the zone
- populate the zone based on the appropriate population pool

#### zone status == hostile
- do nothing?

#### zone status == claimed
- player can perform actions specific to "claimed" territory (ie: territories system)
- remind player of how to access territory actions (radio menu?) menu

### player leaves zone
- if zone status == "claimed" => erase population

### zone contains player but no enemies (enemies all dead)
