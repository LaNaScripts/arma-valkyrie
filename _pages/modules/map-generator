idea: Randomly generate terrain and major features such as small cities and roadsystems purely from code. In terms of scope, the generator should dynamically select and distribute a number of predictable "feature blocks", as well as modifying terrain elements.

A successful end product will be predictable enough to create a logical, believable environment, while still supporting a completely random selection of environmental elements.

Far out for now, but once all of the dynamic content modules have been created, it's the only logical next step. :)
