The website for our mod is up and doing its thing.

In its completed form, the site will feature full information on game concepts, enemies, gear etc. We're avoiding the wiki route at this time however, in order to leave some of the discovering up to players.

Check out the [development timeline](/development/timeline) for the full picture.
